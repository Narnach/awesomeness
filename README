Collective Idea's Awesomeness
=============================

A collection of stuff that we use often, but not generic enough to go in another plugin.

If you've stumbled across this and love/hate it, let us know!

Right now, it consists of:
* A few core extensions, mostly to the collection classes
** Object#tap (http://moonbase.rydia.net/mental/blog/programming/eavesdropping-on-expressions)
** String#widont to make typography nicer (http://shauninman.com/archive/2006/08/22/widont_wordpress_plugin)
* Unicode TextHelper Additions
** Change the default truncate & excerpt string to … instead of ...
** Add widont to textilize methods
* Transparent removal of trailing slashes in URLs.
* some capistrano tasks
* a rake task to rename all .rhtml files to .erb
* some test assertions

TODO:
  * Phone cleanup/validations
