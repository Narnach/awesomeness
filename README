Collective Idea's Awesomeness
=============

A collection of stuff that we use often, but not generic enough to go in another plugin.

Right now, it is simply:
* A few core extensions, mostly to the collection classes
* some capistrano tasks
* a rake task to rename all .rhtml files to .erb
* some test assertionas

TODO:
  * Phone cleanup/validations
